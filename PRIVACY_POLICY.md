# Privacy Policy for Offside Discord Bot

Effective date: 2025-12-28

This Privacy Policy describes how the Offside Discord Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Bot in a Discord server.

## Information We Process

- Discord identifiers: user IDs, usernames, and mentions used to identify coaches and players.
- Roster details: team name, tournament name, player gamertag/PSN, EA ID, console/platform.
- Operational metadata: command inputs, timestamps, and server/channel IDs required to perform actions.
- Eligibility data: ban/blacklist entries accessed from a Google Sheet maintained by staff (e.g., Discord ID, reason, date).

## Sources of Information

- You and your coaches/staff when you submit commands or roster data.
- Discord, which provides identifiers and context for commands.
- Google Sheets, which provides the ban/blacklist used for eligibility checks.

## How We Use Information

- Create and manage tournament rosters.
- Check player eligibility against the ban/blacklist.
- Notify coaches and staff about roster status and tournament reminders.
- Maintain server operations, prevent misuse, and resolve issues.

## Sharing and Disclosure

- Information is shared only within the Discord server (e.g., staff-only channels) to fulfill roster review.
- We do not sell or rent information to third parties.
- Google Sheets is used as a data source for ban/blacklist checks; access is controlled by server staff.

## Data Retention

- Roster data is retained for the duration of the tournament and any post-event review period determined by staff.
- Ban/blacklist data is retained by server staff in Google Sheets and is not controlled by the Bot.
- You may request deletion or correction of roster data via server staff.

## Security

- Access to staff outputs is limited to staff-only channels.
- We use reasonable safeguards, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Your Choices

- You can stop using the Bot at any time.
- Server staff can remove the Bot or delete stored roster data where applicable.

## Children's Privacy

- The Bot is intended for use by Discord users who meet Discord's minimum age requirements.

## Changes to This Policy

- We may update this policy from time to time. The effective date will reflect the latest revision.
